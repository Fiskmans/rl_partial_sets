# Partial Sets
__Do you always forget to bring your void knights gloves, end up doing partial switches or otherwise just end up with funky partial gear sets?__
Then this plugin is for you

### How does it work?
By displaying a infobox with the brightest of red text you could get; Even the blindest of subterranian molerats will not forget to equip all their gear.

### But what if I dont want to grind for a full set of graceful?
Fret not, you can always decide to strip down completely to hide your shame or if, for some reason, you do actually want to wear partial sets you can enable/disable the check for each one individually
